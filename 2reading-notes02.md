And an exhaustive listing of html tags….

## Intro to CSS
I.E. Making it pretty
Thinking inside the box?
Block vs inline elements-block looks like a new line, inline flow within text, ex. <b> <I> <em> etc.

CSS syntax is simple : selector(which element) {declaration property—value}
h1, h2, h3 { font-family: Arial; color: yellow;} Property Value

h1, h2, h3 { font-family: Arial; color: yellow;} Property Value

## *EXTERNAL CSS
<link> lives inside <head> and does not need a closing tag
Href = path to css file
Internal vs external (looks like you usually use external, better for multi page site)

## Duckett JS
