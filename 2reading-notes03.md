## Ducket, Lists

An in depth review of ordered lists, unordered lists and definition lists..

Short and dirty: ordered has numbers, unordered does not. 
<or>
<ul> followed by <li> per item

Definition lists are new to me:looks like exclusively used to define terms a la dictionary. 
<dl> blocks the def, <dt> blocks the term defined, <dd> blocks definition

Nested lists: appear to be good for recipes, just put an <li> inside of another <li>


## Boxes
 A CSS conception: all about borders and padding, and margins.
 Specs are derived from px pixel size, percentages, or shortcuts in vs code (small, med, large etc.)

Padding gives space between objects on the page

Centering is achieved via the text-align property


## Basic Javascript instructions


For some reason this feels like review: did we read this already? 
Statements….end in semi-colon.

Comments, dbl f-slashes…. I totally read this already…

## Decisions and loops
The if statement:
Covered pretty well in lab yesterday, but okay,
If statements check a conditional, if true moves on, 
If else and else if statements evaluate an operation and move down the code block depending on whether or not certain conditionals are met


*Switch value
Aha, something new. Pay attention today and ask about this because you don’t get it.
