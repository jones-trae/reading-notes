##Reading Notes 05
-Images
How to choose them, the why is pretty self explanatory, 
-a good resource for easy to find stock images
<img>, src, alt, title, height, width
-placement in code dictates placement on page….unlessss…CSS

-3 rules: save in right format-jpeg, gif, png.
Save in right size
Use the correct resolution


##Color
Describesd in three ways,(enacted in 3 ways?)
RGB, Hex code, name
The rest of this is art theory 101

##Text
Jesus this is a dry reading day. 
Typeface Terminology
-serif—detailed ends
-sans-serf__see above, but not
-monospace—AHA fixed width type that aligns nicely, used in code, answers a quiz question at last
-weight—thickness
-style—oblique, italic, etc
stretch__thinner closer


##JPEG vs PNG
Ok…the TL;DR version
JPEG natural scenes or photos
PNG-transparency or text with sharp objects, logos, etc
