##Reading notes 07
-Domain Modeling—making a conceptual model in code for a problem…sounds like wire framing..
-tool for communication—between engineers and clients? Laymen’s terms?
And a segue into ‘constructor functions”
Use of the ‘new’ keyword
This reading would have been very helpful 5 days ago
-Random number generator?!?!?!? NOW?!?1 we get this now?!?!
VERY clear where we are are going with this; todays lab work will almost certainly be to refactor hourly like and daily/hourle cookie sales with a constructor object

##Ducket Ch. 6-Tables
<table>table element
<tr>table row
<td>cell
<th>table heading
Also clear where this is going…..
Also useful here is the table templates…..mmmmhmmm

##Duckett
Again I feel like this reading should have been days ago.
I do not have time for this last reading. Will catch up later bt a skim of it shows what I know already: 

##Object modeling, and Document Object Model-more of this, then. Still not mentioned in lecture and unsure of the immediate utility of this reading. Will see today perhaps.
