LAYOUT



this was a re-Read of reading assignment 04 which is great because I barely read it then. 
The biggest chapter ever.
Block vs inline:block starts on its own line, in line interrupts linesâ€¦is IN LiNES
-One Block element in another is related as a 'parent child' relationship

-Normal vs relative vs absolute positioning vs fixed
Aha a float-excellent for floating a blockquote allows a text body to float arount a blockquote=italicise and border the float top and bottome, looks sharp ex in text
-caution some browsers deal with parents of floated objects poorly



-screen size and resolution
fixed vs liquid=liquid changes size as browser does...seems bst

-grids- with EXAMPLES ref back to this! the 960.gs grid! so handy, also multi style sheets linking.
