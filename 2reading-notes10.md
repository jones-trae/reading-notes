##Duckett Ch. 10
-Debugging in JS

-the console and dev tools
Reading the order of execution-unintuitive
-The STACK?
-context and hoisting
:prepare, execute

-Scope! Cont-we have been over this slightly-certainly going to cover in lecture
-Error objects-covers terminology of error messages***VERY USEFUL****
Ex missing closing bracket error is denoted as expected ‘)’?!?!

-How to deal with errors
Debug the script….hunh. that easy
Orrr try, catch, throw, statements?

-Workflow-this alllll seems pretty intuitive until the chapter explains the try catch throw process. Also lists instructions on how to use dev console in several browser types. Firefox? Does anyone still use it?
-Ch. Ends with a handy list of common errors
