1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’? An input form element whose value is controlled by react from a single source of truth
2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why. Wait. I have no idea yet
3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
4. Unclear

1. Why would we use a ternary operator? Shorter and easier
2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:  if(x===y){
3.  console.log(true);
4.   } else {
5.  console.log(false);
6.   }
7. X ===y ? Value if true : value if false
## Things I want to know more about making the ternary operator more complex in function and syntax?
