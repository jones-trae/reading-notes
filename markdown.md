# Reading Notes for Markdown

Let's start with the basics: Github is an online network of coding-based knowledge and repositories of information that developers use to share projects and collaborate with one another. Individuals can create a profile and begin using various coding tools to create projects, pages, and directories in a public sphere; open to comments and ammendments by other developers. These repostitories can then be easily turned into live webpages via Github's in-house programming tool, Pages. Direct text is translated into html and published in an incredibly easy manner.

### Markdown

How that information is displayed can be manipulated easily using a syntax system called Markdown. Without using databases, Markdown uses simplifies symbols such as asterixes and pound signs to amment plain text into headings, tables, different colors, and links. For example if I wanted to create a [link]() to the live URL of this short blog post, I would wrap the tab lettering in square brackets followed by the URL itself in parentheses. Simple, no?
