**Choosing a Text Editor**

Choosing a text editor is a personal decision, one based on preference, ease of use, and suitability to the project.
*Also*
1.Code Completion , 
a concept wherein a text editor finishes a code snippet via predictive text is an important feature to look for.
2.Syntax highlighting,
3. Theme variety
4. Extension selections
should aall factor into this choice.
In my case, working on an M1 Mac OSX machine, the notpad and Text Editor features are handy, built in programs, but I believe there are better options.
I would like to explore the pros-andcons of Atom, a program I have seen used widely in previous schools. IDE's apparently are ever-evolving, and new features are a constant. 

##Using the Command Line Interface

How to open the terminal on MAC OSX:
1.Hit Cmd + Space and Spotlight to the terminal. Voila.

How to find out where you are
1. PWD = present working directory.
2.ls = list, shows you what is there, in the directory
3. cd = change directory, cd .. = move back a directory
4. PATHS, bothe relative and absolute....this I'll have to ask about.
5. File types = everything in lINux is a file, with 2-4 letter extensions that describe the file type, ie JPEG, PNG, TXT, etc.
6. LiNUX is case sensitive, and hates spaces.
