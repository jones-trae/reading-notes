##Reading Notes 07

**Expressions and Operators**
Provided was a list of all the expression and operator symbols in Script https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#assignment_operators

News to me: there are binary, ternary, and unary operators(ones with one operand and an operator. Hunh.

Assignment operators assign a value to its right based on its left ex. The = sign..simplest. This list is exhaustive and requires further review, 30 mins is not enough. Some tidbits, the ternary or condition operator is the only one that accepts 3 operands


##Functions

-building blocks of JS;Declaration and and then name of function (lowercase, camel case) and then statements that define the function {}

Scope :HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA yeah noooo, nooooooo lets do this later.

###MDN Control Flow
Order that a computer executes statements in a script.

Usually top to bottom except when the computer encounters a loop or a conditional,(often.)-control structures

Function syntax…’function name (parameters)’

JS runs functions until they hit a return statement

()= operator that calls the function


concatenate+connect strings
